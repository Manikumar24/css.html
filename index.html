<h3>CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!</h3>
Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. 
Click on the "Stylesheet 1", "Stylesheet 2", "Stylesheet 3", "Stylesheet 4" links below to see the different styles:
<h3>Selector types</h3>
<li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
<li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
<li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id</li>
<li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li>
<li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
